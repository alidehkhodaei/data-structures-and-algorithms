# Data Structures and Algorithms
<img src="https://github.com/alidehkhodaei/dsa/raw/main/banner.png" alt="Banner">
Algorithms and data structures are essential concepts in computer science. Algorithms are a set of instructions that can be followed to solve a particular problem. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. 

This repository contains the Kotlin solutions with unit tests for Data Structures and Algorithms. These questions provided by <a href='https://github.com/loveBabbar'>Love Babbar</a>.
